Building a Progressive Web App from scratch in Polymer
====

In this codelab, youâ€™ll build a Progressive Web App in Polymer that will let users watch videos from the Chrome developer channel. You will learn how to set up the pages, layout, routes, and an infinite list.

## Progressive Web Apps

Progressive Web Apps are web applications that take advantage of new web technologies to act and feel like a native app. Progressive web apps work for every user regardless of the browser choice, they are reliable, fast and secure. However, building a Progressive Web App from scratch with such requirements can be tedious and complex. As we will see, thanks to web components, a set of W3C standards, most of the complex logic can be encapsulated in a component allowing you to build better and faster progressive web apps. 

## What is the Polymer App Toolbox?

The Polymer App Toolbox is a collection of web components, tools and templates for building Progressive Web Apps. The App Toolbox includes components for layout, routing, localization and storage. It also offers a very handy command line tool, the Polymer CLI, which we can use to scaffold, serve and build our app among other

## What are we going to be building?

In this codelab, you're going to build an app to browse and watch shows from the Chrome Developer Channel.

The App toolbox will allow us to:
* Architect a component-based web app using Polymer and Web Components.
* Build the responsive layout using the app-layout components.
* Set up the routes using app-route.
* Configure the manifest.json.
* Deploy service workers automatically for offline caching.
* Build the app bundle for production.
